## Overview

Want to hack using this content? Feel free!

You can create a hackathon of any length building on Green Tech, but these instructions are for a two-hour Micro-Hack.

### Current Hackathon: Green Forum Micro-Hack, July 16th, 2020 with Microsoft Interns and Student Ambassadors worldwide.

### Schedule June 16 (all time zones PST - Pacific Standard Time)

### Team formation

For this short micro-hack, you can form teams or work alone. Try to build some application in one hour using the APIs listed on the README. Post your results to #GreenHacks and you might win a prize!

### Project requirements

This is a hackathon about green technologies, so feel free to use our suggested APIs, or use others you know of. The only requirement is that your hack has something to do with going green, being more ecologically-aware, reducing waste, or other environmentally-friendly helps. You can PR this repo to suggest other APIs or systems to use. Let's learn together!

### Presentations and judging

For this micro-hack, we'd like to showcase your work on Twitter. Please use the #GreenHacks hashtag and we will retweet particularly great hacks.

#### Scoring

We evaluate your projects based on the following rubric:

-   Does the project address a clear need, problem, or opportunity, and is the solution clearly explained?
-   Does the project include innovations in technical design or implementation of services or user experience?
-   Does the project have a clear target market or audience?
-   Is the project's purpose and basic functionality easily understood?

## Suggested Projects

Create a web app that:

-   changes color according to the carbon intensity of your region

-   includes a running tally, updated hourly, with a chart of the carbon intensity of your region

-   tells you which of your appliances would be good to run at which hour

Create a connection between an Azure Function using one of the APIs below to trigger a Logic App to do something like send a reminder to charge your EV

### Tips and tricks

Working as a team? Remember the goal is to create a working solution as a team. With the short amount of time available, this will only be accomplished if your team works as a team. Divide and conquer the work. Lean on people's strengths. Get everyone involved, and listen to all ideas!

**Happy hacking!**
